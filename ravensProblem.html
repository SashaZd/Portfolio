										<h3>Raven's Progressive Matrices</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Designed & developed an AI agent in Python that could solve the 2x1, 2x2, 3x3 IQ test using Knowledge Based AI techniques as part of the projects implemented in theKnowledge Based AI class (GaTech CS 7637) with Prof. Ashok Goel.</p>
									<p>The Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) test is a commonly used test of general human intelligence. The RPM is somewhat unique as a general intelligence test in that it focuses on visual problem solving, and in particular, on visual similarity and analogy. Four individual projects were developed to solve propositional, imagistic, and multimodal representations of the RPM in increasing complexity, and to investigate how using different representations could contribute to a visual problem solving by an AI agent. </p>

									<h3>Background Research :</h3>
									<p>Possible solution algorithms were analysed to solve RPM. The shortlisted methods were chosen based on their efficiency and accuracy. They were : 
									<li class="bullets">Generate & Test Method </li> 
									<li class="bullets">Semantic Networks </li> 
									<li class="bullets">Means End Analysis </li></p>

									<h3>Visual Reasoning for the Agent (Project 4)</h3>
									<p>Since the problems given to the agent were visual instead of propositional in the last project, the project agent had to be modified accordingly. OpenCV was chosen due to it’s ease of use and integration with Python. The findContours method was implemented to find both the contours of the image and the hierarchy of the objects found so as to find nested shapes.</p>

									<h4><font color="#33366A" size=4><b>Problems with Shape Duplication</b></font></h4>
									<p>Open CV was picking up both the inner and outer contours for each “un-filled shape”. This would mean that instead of finding one circle in 2x1 Basic Problem 01, it would discover 2. This lead to incorrect data since this was inconsistent with the logic used for deletion of objects from the figure. 
									<br /><br />To solve this the moment of the image was calculated, and then used the moment to find the centroid (cx, cy) and the area of the image. Theoretically, if the area and the centroid of the image were the same, then the shape was the same (and a duplicate). 
									<br /><br />In reality, the area between the outer contour and inner contour was really similar, and also the centroid would remain the same. To compensate for this, it was required for us to minutely add a threshold to the area comparison until differences could be discovered between images under the following circumstances : 
									<li class="bullets">The image was a single shape that was being discovered twice. </li>
									<li class="bullets">The image contained 2 or more shapes, one inside another, both of the same shape type (eg. both circles). In this case, 4 circles would be discovered and we would need to find the difference between deleting a duplicate image shape and deleting a real shape. </li>
									<br /><center><img src="images/projects/rpm2.png" /></center>
									<br />To fix this, the threshold comparison of the area of the circle was adjusted. It was found that the optimal adjustment was a difference of 3000px in area. This accounted for changes in shape of small/large shapes as well as dual shapes one inside another. 
									</p>
